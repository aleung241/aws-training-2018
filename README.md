# AWS Training 2018

##Module 1: Core AWS Knowledge

|IAM|S3|EC2
|Route53|VPC|ELastic Block Store (EBS)
| |Internet Gateway|Subnet

#### Regions
- Data is regionally scoped - a region is a boundary for data
  
[Cloudping](cloudping.info) to see pings for different regions relative to yourself  

- Edge locations for globally scoped services
- AZ scoped services require you to make highly available - single points of failure
- Two or more AZ's
- 18 regions worldwide
- YOU enable and control data replication across regions
- Communication between regions uses AWS backbone connections but not guaranteed


*Multi region use cases: Netflix*

#### AWS Datacenters
- Smaller data centers. But lots of them
- Houses several thousand servers
- All online. None are cold
- Designed for AZ failure

#### Availability Zones
- Made of one or more data centers
- Designed for fault isolation
- Interconnected with other AZ's using high-speed private links
- AWS recommends replicating AZ's for resilience

### Unmanaged vs Managed Services

#### Unmanaged

a.k.a. Self-managed  
- Scaling, fault tolderance, and availability are managed by YOU. AWS does not do this for you

*e.g. EC2*

#### Managed
Typically built into the service. These are fully managed by AWS

e.g. RDS

---

####Security Responsibilities
-	Physical security, control, need-based access
-	Data centre locations are usually hidden
-	Infrastructure, knowing when it will fail 
-	Network infrastructure, intrusion detection. Canâ€™t test own security or will be deemed as an attack.
-	Virtualisation infrastructure, hardware is dedicated to your instance 
-	Patch and maintain your OWN operating systems, AWS does not provide the service 
-	Think about user positions and role base access 
-	Security groups 
-	Intrusion protection 
-	Separation of access 

## Module 2: Core Services

#### Networking
- VPC is not a data center replacement
- VPC is a singularly logical isolated network
- Public vs private, indirect access

#### EC2
- Virtual machines
- Placement groups: logical goruping of machines
- Instance storage is ephemeral. Shut downs clear it. Reboots keep it. 
- A shutdown then startup will spin up a new instance, clearing instance storage  
- Hardware is isolated to your instance except the T2 instance type. T2 is shared hardware  

Low/Moderate/High - Placement group - logical grouping of machines

Spot instances - choose highest price to continue using the machine. Imagine an auction?

**Careful! Giving full access to EC2 allows access to VPCs**

#### Amazon Machine Image

Used to create EC2 instances

---

#### Tags
- Sort, search, filter
- Recommended not to use tag "name". It's completely useless since everything already has a name
- Use eg. role, owner, environment, startTime, finishTime
- Basically metadata

---

### Storage

#### S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- Scalable, reliable, fast, durable
- Not a file system
- Object based storage
- 5TB per object
- Global Unique. No need for arn to specify region

One-zone infrequent access
- Less availability
- Used for backups
- Really new storage type offer

#### Elastic File System (EFS)
- Shared storage
- Expose and mount

#### Elastic Block Store (EBS)
- Snapshots stored in S3, regionally scoped due to S3 duplication

#### IAM
**Delete root access keys right after sign up!**
- Identity user management
- Access keys for APIs
- Can create temporary credentials to a user to assume a role
- Groups!
- Policies can be attached to groups, users or roles

#### VPC
- Regionally scoped
- 1 VPC can only have 1 Internet Gateway

#### Subnet
- Each subnet must have its own CIDR block. They cannot overlap
- Only one route table associated per subnet

#### Elastic IP
- Public IP that is statically assigned

#### Security Groups
- App level protection
- No blacklisting option available. Default behaviour is to block already
- You can open ports on other security groups in case IP changes
|
#### NACL
- Subnet level protection
- Explicit blacklisting option available

#### NAT
- Indirect internet access
- Useful for hiding machines

### Databases

#### RDS
- Managed service
- Relational DBs
- Do not use for massive read/write rates
- Bad throughput rate

#### DynamoDB
- SQL DB service
- Used for scale and performance
- No relationships








## CF Parameters
- Allow human interaction
- Constraintdescrition - error message

Ref goes to parameter  
Auto rollback can be changed to be manually fixed
